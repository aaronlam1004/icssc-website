## Welcome to the offical repo for the ICSSC website!

### To contribute:
- Create a new branch with a name describing the feature you plan to add
- Edit any of the HTML files in the root directory, or navigate to the `assets/stylesheets` directory to modify the CSS
- Create a pull request explaining the changes you made. We'll review your changes and — if they look good — merge them in!

### Future plans for the website
- [ ] Add Dark Mode (currently in review)
- [ ] Add new logo and branding once that's been finalized
- [ ] Rewrite in React for greater maintainability and ease of development
- [ ] Configure GitHub Pages to automatically deploy on pushes to main (possibly with a GitHub Action)
